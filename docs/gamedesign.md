## Gameplay

### Overview of Gameplay

The game is a Turn Based Strategy game with roguelite mechanic. It is deeply inspired by the **Hoplite** mobile game (see [Hoplite Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magmafortress.hoplite&hl=en_US) ).

The main target platform is **Mobile** (Android, iOS) mostly because the gameplay is strongly tuned for touch, but it can easily be played with a mouse or a Joypad on **Desktop** and **Console** platforms.

On **Desktop** and **Console** there will be minimal changes to the UI in order to be playable:
- There will be an indicator to select the cells of the grid and warrior actions.
- Some actions could be mapped to Keyboard keys or Joypad button.

The game offers these modes: **Tutorial**, **Adventure** and **Infinite Dungeon**. Further in this document there is an in-depth explanation of each mode, but here is a brief description:
- **Tutorial** explains the game basics.
- **Adventure** are quests with a story and a goal. Adventures may be grouped in Adventure Set which are connected collection of Adventures that can be unlocked one after the other.
- **Infinite Dungeon** is a challenge of randomly generated dungeons where the goal is to go as deep as possible in the dungeon.

**Adventure** and **Infinite Dungeon** modes gives points to the Player. Points are used to create Leaderboards and to unlock permanent Skills for the Warrior.

### Player Experience

First time Players are immediately taken to the Tutorial so that they can learn the basic mechanics of the game.

Provide a general overview of how the player experiences the game. Walk them through the screens they will see, what the level looks like and what their character can do. Give them a brief idea of objectives & hazards they will face.  This should be in a second-person point of view using the word “you” to tell a story to the audience (players).

### Gameplay Guidelines

This is a set of guidelines that the game must adhere to throughout the development process. These include rules for what is allowed and not allowed in the game. For instance, if you are creating a game for children, you will want to define guidelines for the level of violence presented in the game, what language can be used, and so on.
